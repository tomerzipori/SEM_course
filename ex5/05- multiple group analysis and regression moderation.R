# Testing Group-Related Hypotheses ----------------------------------------
# Using modifiers


# Lets focus on the cov between (residual) BAI and trauma: Do men and woman
# differ on the `.BAI ~~ trauma` parameter?
#
# We have two ways of testing this:
# 1. Computed the estimate (:=).
# 2. Comparing a constrained model.





## Comparing parameters ------------

# When working with a multi-group model, modifiers must be specified as VECTORS.
# For example, to estimate the difference in the covariance between men and
# woman, we can:


mod <- '
  ## latent variable definitions (CFA)
  Psypath =~  BAI + BDI
    Sleep =~  sleep1 + sleep2 + sleep3

  ## Regressions
  Psypath ~ Sleep + trauma

  ## Covariances
  trauma ~~ c(cvW, cvM) * BAI
  
  ## Computed estimates
  cv_diff := cvM - cvW
'

fit_groups <- sem(mod, data = group_data, 
                  group = "gender")
summary(fit_groups, standardize = TRUE)

# we can see the that difference in cov is 0.39 (or the difference in
# correlation is 0.25), and is significant.







## Constrain parameters across groups ------------

# We can also use modifiers to CONSTRAIN a model:
mod_eq_cov <- '
  ## latent variable definitions (CFA)
  Psypath =~  BAI + BDI
    Sleep =~  sleep1 + sleep2 + sleep3

  ## Regressions
  Psypath ~ Sleep + trauma

  ## Covariances
  trauma ~~ c(cv, cv) * BAI
'
# What is implied by this model?


fit_groups_eq_cov <- sem(mod_eq_cov, data = group_data, 
                         group = "gender")

summary(fit_groups_eq_cov, standardize = TRUE)



# Compare the models

bayestestR::bayesfactor_models(fit_groups, denominator = fit_groups_eq_cov)
# What do these mean?













# Measurement Invariance --------------------------------------------------


# https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.mlr.0000245454.12228.8f

# Measurement invariance is a statistical property of measurement that indicates
# that the same construct is being measured across some specified groups / time.
# Often we just assume this - but with SEM we can also test this directly.
# 
# (These tests are done on the measurement model.)



# To test/validate measurement invariance, we can tell lavaan to set all
# parameters of one (or more) types to be equal ACROSS GROUPS. There are several
# "classes" of parameters we can constrain using the `group.equal` argument:
#
# -             "loadings" : all latent factor loadings
# -          "regressions" : all regression coefficients
# - "residual.covariances" : the (residual?) covariances of the observed vars
# -       "lv.covariances" : the (residual?) covariances of the latent vars
# -            "residuals" : the (residual?) variances of the observed vars
# -         "lv.variances" : the (residual?) variances of the latent vars
# -           "intercepts" : the intercepts of the observed variables
# -                "means" : the intercepts/means of the latent variables
#
# Usually we want to test the loadings (weak invariance) and
# intercepts/means (strong invariance) of latent variables (but this can change
# depending on your theory/data).

# What if you want to constrain all the parameter of a type, but 1 or 2?
# More options are covered hare: http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/groups.html



# Let's first build a measurement model:

meas_mod <- "
  ## latent variable definitions (CFA)
  Psypath =~  BAI + BDI
    Sleep =~  sleep1 + sleep2 + sleep3

  ## Covariances
  Psypath ~~ Sleep + trauma
   trauma ~~ BAI

  ## Self Regressions
  # Remeber this?
  trauma ~ 1 * trauma
"

fit_meas <- cfa(meas_mod, data = group_data, 
                group = "gender")


# Fix 'em:
fit_weakInv <- cfa(meas_mod, data = group_data, 
                   group.equal = c("loadings"),
                   group = "gender")

fit_strongInv <- cfa(meas_mod, data = group_data, 
                     group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts"), 
                     group = "gender")


anova(fit_meas, fit_weakInv, fit_strongInv)
bayestestR::bayesfactor_models(fit_weakInv, fit_strongInv,
                               denominator = fit_meas)
# What does this mean?

#regression moderation-----

library(interactions)

#Build an equation
names(group_data)
lm1 <- lm(trauma ~ BDI*sleep1 , data = group_data)
summary(lm1)
#Analyze simple slopes

# Compute the mean and standard deviation of the moderator
mean_X2 <- mean(group_data$sleep1, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_X2 <- sd(group_data$sleep1, na.rm = TRUE)

sim_slopes(lm1, pred = BDI, modx = sleep1, modx.values = c(mean_X2 - sd_X2, mean_X2, mean_X2 + sd_X2))

# Visualize the interaction
interact_plot(lm1, pred = BDI, modx = sleep1, plot.points = TRUE, interval = TRUE, int.width = 0.95)


# Exercise ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Going back to the STRUCTURAL model:
# 1. Fit a model constraining a group equality on the intercepts. 
#    - Compare it (test) to the unconstrained model.
#    What do you make of the results?
#
# 2. For the effect of Sleep on Psypath:
#    - Compute the difference in slopes between the groups.
#    - Fit a model with an equality on this parameter. Compare to the
#      unrestricted model.
#    What do you make of the results?
